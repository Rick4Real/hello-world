Hello Everyone!
An explanation of my username - Rick4Real has a double meaning:
1. The thrust of my career has been writing realtime code (primarily in C or C++).
2. I try to keep it real in my personal and professional life also. Never submitted an inflated resume and never over billed a client.  Actually have the opposite problem; tend to understate, when I shouldn't :)
